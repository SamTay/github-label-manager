# label-manager
Simplified label manager via json packages

This is basically a slim wrapper over [jasonbellamy/git-label](https://github.com/jasonbellamy/git-label). It oversimplifies
the usage so that you can basically change a couple configuration values (such as user, repository, token, etc.) and
immediately swap out profiles (i.e., packages) of git labels. This is useful for starting repositories, managing label packages,
and trying out new packages.
